# Public Interview Notes
Hi There :)

I take notes to help me not make the same mistakes in my next interview and have something to look back on. All of these are beginner friendly. I take notes as if I'm tutoring someone. 

All the notes are in the python files themselves. I didnt wanna jump between READMEs and the code so all the notes are commented out for me to read along. Feel free to snoop around.
